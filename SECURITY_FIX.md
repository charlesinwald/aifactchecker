# Security Fix: GEMINI API KEY Protection

## Issue Identified
The GEMINI API KEY was exposed in the client-side code and visible in the browser's developer tools Sources tab.

## Root Cause
The API key was configured as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` in the environment variables. In Next.js, any environment variable prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is made available to the client-side code and gets bundled into the JavaScript sent to the browser.

## Security Risk
- API key visible in browser developer tools
- Anyone inspecting the page source could access the API key
- Potential for API key abuse and unauthorized usage
- Violation of API security best practices

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Server-Side API Route
- Created `/src/app/api/fact-check/route.ts` - a Next.js API route that runs server-side only
- Moved all Gemini AI logic to the server-side endpoint
- API key is now only accessible on the server

### 2. Updated Environment Variable
- Changed from `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` to `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Removed the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix to keep the variable server-side only

### 3. Modified Client-Side Code
- Updated `src/app/services/geminiService.ts` to call the secure API route
- Removed direct Gemini AI client initialization from client-side code
- Client now makes HTTP requests to `/api/fact-check` endpoint

### 4. Added Security Documentation
- Created `.env.example` with secure configuration
- Updated README.md with security warnings and setup instructions
- Enhanced .gitignore to prevent accidental commits of environment files

## Files Modified
- `src/app/api/fact-check/route.ts` (new)
- `src/app/services/geminiService.ts` (updated)
- `.env.example` (new)
- `README.md` (updated)
- `.gitignore` (enhanced)

## Next Steps
1. Update your environment variables:
   - Remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Add `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here` to `.env.local`
2. Restart your development server
3. Verify the API key is no longer visible in browser developer tools

## Verification
After implementing these changes:
- The API key will not appear in the browser's Sources tab
- The fact-checking functionality remains unchanged
- All API calls are now proxied through the secure server-side endpoint
